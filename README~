This script will load the last used status when empathy restarts or
when one of the accounts of the user comes online.

How to use this:
(These guidelines are for Ubuntu 11.04 . But procedure will be lot common
in other Linux flavours too)

 1).Create a folder named ".scripts" in the home directory. Copy this script to that folder.
 2).Go to Startup Application Preferences (search for "startup" in dashboard).
 3).Click Add.
 4).Give any Name you like.
 5).In Command, click on Browse and select your script from the file browser (which is in
    /home/<Your user name>/.scripts)
 6).Add a comment if you like.

 Now the script will run from the next time you login to the computer. Have fun. And don't forget to give me feedback :-)
